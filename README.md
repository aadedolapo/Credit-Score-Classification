The credit score of a person determines the creditworthiness of the person. It helps financial companies determine if you can repay the loan or credit you are applying for.

Here is a dataset based on the credit score classification submitted by Rohan Paris on Kaggle. Below are all the features in the dataset:

* ID: Unique ID of the record
* Customer_ID: Unique ID of the customer
* Month: Month of the year
* Name: The name of the person
* Age: The age of the person
* SSN: Social Security Number of the person
* Occupation: The occupation of the person
* Annual_Income: The Annual Income of the person
* Monthly_Inhand_Salary: Monthly in-hand salary of the person
* Num_Bank_Accounts: The number of bank accounts of the person
* Num_Credit_Card: Number of credit cards the person is having
* Interest_Rate: The interest rate on the credit card of the person
* Num_of_Loan: The number of loans taken by the person from the bank
* Type_of_Loan: The types of loans taken by the person from the bank
* Delay_from_due_date: The average number of days delayed by the person from the date of payment
* Num_of_Delayed_Payment: Number of payments delayed by the person
* Changed_Credit_Card: The percentage change in the credit card limit of the person
* Num_Credit_Inquiries: The number of credit card inquiries by the person
* Credit_Mix: Classification of Credit Mix of the customer
* Outstanding_Debt: The outstanding balance of the person
* Credit_Utilization_Ratio: The credit utilization ratio of the credit card of the customer
* Credit_History_Age: The age of the credit history of the person
* Payment_of_Min_Amount: Yes if the person paid the minimum amount to be paid only, otherwise no.
* Total_EMI_per_month: The total EMI per month of the person
* Amount_invested_monthly: The monthly amount invested by the person
* Payment_Behaviour: The payment behaviour of the person
* Monthly_Balance: The monthly balance left in the account of the person
* Credit_Score: The credit score of the person

The Credit_Score column is the target variable in this problem. You are required to find relationships based on how banks classify credit scores and train a model to classify the credit score of a person.

# Data Science Pipelines to follow
1. Data/Domain Understanding and Exploration 
(e.g., load the data, sample observations, check correct parsing of data, identify quantitative and qualitative features, analyse data distributions (e.g., range, centrality,  dispersion, shape))
2. Data Processing 
(e.g., detect and deal with noise (i.e., erroneous values), missing values, and outliers; subset, reshape, and engineer features improved analysis)
3. Association and Group Differences Analysis 
(e.g., based on correlations, conditioning, group differences)


## Data Science Tasks to Perform

1. What are the best predictors to classify an individual cridt score
2. what are those that seem to have to strongest association with the credit score of a person
3. what are the explanations and insights behind those findings?
4. What are interesting groupings of the data, involving one or two features, that show significant differences (e.g., trends, averages) in price? What can we learn from them and how useful could these findings be for the business?
